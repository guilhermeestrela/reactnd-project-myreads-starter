# MyReads Project

Project for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Course.
This is a React app that shows you a list of myRead books.

You can categorize the books in three shelfs:
- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

You also can search for new books, and add then on you list.

## Demo 

The project demo is available [here](https://guilhermeestrela-mybooks.herokuapp.com/)

## How to run

To run the project, you need to:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
You can check the project search terms. [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
